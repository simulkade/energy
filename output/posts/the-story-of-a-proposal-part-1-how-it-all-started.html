    <p>It was autumn 2007. I was working as a process engineer and instructor, mostly an instructor. Not a real job when I look back, although the payment was quite good. Sometimes even better than a real job. I was in touch with Hans Bruining, my then PhD supervisor, via phone and Skype. None of them worked very well for the connections and my English were both terrible. Hans was a bit frustrated with the long time that he had to wait for the paperwork to be done, mostly on my side. He asked me to start working on the first phase of the UCG project: Underground Coal Gasification. He had sent me a presentation that explained briefly the plan for writing a mathematical model. I was familiar with the process of the gasification of coal. Being a professional and lazy instructor of commercial process simulators, my main source of information was the tutorial section of the documentations and the <code>examples</code> folder of Aspen Plus. I had read the few gasification examples and knew that Aspen Plus could characterize coal and model its reactions with simple chemical equilibrium model. How much do we owe Mr. Gibbs? The procedure was simple. Find the thermodynamic properties of coal, i.e., Gibbs energy of formation, specific heat capacity, and molar composition. Mix a certain amount of coal with air and steam, and assume a few other gaseous products that can be produced from the reaction between carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. I assumed nitrogen is not reactive and there is no sulfur in coal. Reasonable assumptions. I solved the equations with Aspen Plus and obtained acceptable results.<br>
I don't remember correctly if it was for making a good impression on my supervisor or because there was no Aspen Plus license in my supervisor's research group, or perhaps the former rationalized by the later: I suddenly decided that I want to write the Gibbs energy minimization in Matlab, which I did. It was not a total waste of time as it turned out later. We managed to sell the code in addition to a literature review to a company for a small amount of money, which was very helpful for me. Anyway, I wrote the Matlab code and wrote a report that was basically the original draft of my most important paper, published later in Energy.<br>
When I moved to Delft with my 3-month pregnant wife, Hans had already presented the results of the model in a project meeting, held in Delft just before I arrive in March 2008. The first thing my supervisor told me was about what happened to him in the swimming pool. Don't worry. It wasn't any of those things. He met his friend, a retired Chemical Engineering Professor, and they talked about this gasification project. My supervisor's friend, Professor Jacob de Swan Aarons, suggested that we do an exergy analysis of the whole process. Hans told me that he does not know what exergy is. But we can order two copies of his friend's book, "Efficiency and Sustainability in the Energy and Chemical Industries", and start reading and learning together. I must tell the younger people that it is not at all normal that you hear your supervisor telling you he does not know a topic. It doesn't work like this in academia. My supervisor is an exception.  </p>

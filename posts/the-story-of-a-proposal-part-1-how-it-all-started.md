It was autumn 2007. I was working as a process engineer and instructor, mostly an instructor. Not a real job when I look back, although the payment was quite good. Sometimes even better than a real job. I was in touch with Hans Bruining, my then PhD supervisor, via phone and Skype. None of them worked very well for the connections and my English were both terrible. Hans was a bit frustrated with the long time that he had to wait for the paperwork to be done, mostly on my side. He asked me to start working on the first phase of the UCG project: Underground Coal Gasification. He had sent me a presentation that explained briefly the plan for writing a mathematical model. I was familiar with the process of the gasification of coal. Being a professional and lazy instructor of commercial process simulators, my main source of information was the tutorial section of the documentations and the `examples` folder of Aspen Plus. I had read the few examples and knew that Aspen Plus could characterize coal and model its reactions with simple chemical equilibrium model. How much do we owe Mr. Gibbs?
